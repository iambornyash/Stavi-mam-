
The complainant’s right to be heard in bail proceedings includes the right to object to the bail of the accused.
Their objections must be considered by the court before granting or rejecting bail application.

Right includes :

1. Right to receive notice of the bail application (especially in serious offences).

2. Right to appear (personally or through a lawyer) in court.

3. Right to place objections against granting bail.

4. Right to give reasons why granting bail may be harmful, such as:

4.1 Accused may threaten the complainant or witnesses.

4.2 Accused may flee.

4.3 Offence is grave or the evidence is strong.


In Section 439(1A) CrPC, the victim must be heard in bail hearings for serious offences like rape and POCSO.

Supreme Court judgments repeatedly stress that victims/complainants must be given an opportunity to oppose bail, especially in heinous crimes.


In Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023

- > BNSS Section 483(2)
1. Tells that in offences punishable with 7 years or more, the court must give the victim an opportunity to be heard before granting bail.

2. In serious offences (punishable with 7+ years), the victim/complainant must be informed about the bail application.

3. They must be given a chance to appear and object.

4. Bail cannot be granted behind the complainant’s back.



For Small / less than 7+ offences :


1. No statutory mandatory right for complainant in offences < 7 years

For crimes punishable with less than 7 years, BNSS does not create a mandatory requirement to hear the complainant before granting bail.

Section 484(1)(a) applies only to 7+ year offences.

So for minor/moderate offences, the court can grant bail even without hearing the complainant.



2. But complainant may still be heard — "judge’s discretion"

Even in offences < 7 years, the complainant can be heard if:

The complainant appears in court

The complainant requests to be heard

The court believes the victim’s input is relevant (threats, intimidation, repeat conduct, etc.)

This is discretionary — not mandatory.


3. Police must still inform the complainant in many cases

Even when mandatory hearing is not required, the complainant often gets:

Notice of bail hearing, or

Information from Investigating Officer


4. Victims can still object

Even in minor cases, the complainant can:

File a written objection

Appear through a lawyer ( By saying Argue risk of intimidation, tampering of evidence, etc. )

The court may consider it, but is not required by law to do so before granting bail.
