1. Decided On: 18.04.2022

Jagjeet Singh and Ors. Vs. Ashish Mishra and Ors. ..(+)

 : MANU/SC/0491/2022

Judegment : 
High Court bail order quashed.
Respondent must surrender immediately.
Bail to be reconsidered by High Court with fair procedure, respecting both accused’s rights and victims’ rights.
Supreme Court did not express any opinion on merits of the case.

2. Decided On: 01.02.2024

Jitendra Kumar Vs. The State of Jharkhand and ors.

Hon'ble Judges/Coram:

 : MANU/JH/0123/2024

The Supreme Court emphasised that:

“In prosecutions for offences under Section 376 IPC, notice to the victim and opportunity of hearing is mandatory under Section 439(1A) CrPC.”
This is now settled law:
Victim’s objection is not a formality — it is a substantive, enforceable right.
Hence, bail granted in sexual offences without hearing the victim = illegal and liable to be set aside.

Prem Singh Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh
Prem Singh vs. State of Himachal Pradesh (19.02.2020 - HPHC) : MANU/HP/0200/2020

Supreme Court: Bail order set aside because High Court ignored the complainant/victim’s objections & material factors

This case is one of the strongest authorities where the Supreme Court quashes a bail order because:
The High Court ignored crucial objections raised (by the complainant & prosecution).
The High Court failed to consider accused’s criminal history.
The High Court granted bail mechanically on parity.
The Supreme Court emphasised that danger to witnesses & complainant must be given full weight.
This directly supports the principle:
A complainant/victim has a right to place objections, and courts must meaningfully consider them before granting bail.

4. Decided On: 03.05.2001
Puran and Ors. Vs. Rambilas and Ors.
 : MANU/SC/0326/


Puran v. Rambilas (MANU/SC/0326/2001)

“Power under Section 439(2) can be invoked not only by the State but by any aggrieved party.”
“Complainant is not a stranger; he has every right to move for cancellation of bail.”
“High Court can cancel bail where the order granting bail is vitiated by serious infirmity.”

These lines directly help to reflect that:

Before granting bail, court must hear complainant.
If complainant’s objections were not considered, the bail order is illegal.


5. Decided On: 26.09.2025
Pallabi Shil Vs. The State of Tripura and Ors.
 : MANU/TR/0299/2025


The application was filed under Section 483(3) of the BNSS, 2023 (Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita). 
This is a bail cancellation / revocation application (i.e., challenging the bail already granted).

Victim’s Right to Be Heard
The High Court strongly affirmed the victim’s participatory rights. 
The Court held that the rights of a “victim” (distinct from a complainant or informant) are substantive and enforceable; they are not merely accessory to the State’s role. 
The Court explicitly said that a victim has a legally vested right to be heard at every step after the occurrence of the offense, including at the time of bail grant or cancellation.



6. XXX vs. The State (04.09.2025 - CALHC)
MANU/WB/1964/2025
It addresses the victim's right to be heard in bail proceedings under the new Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023. 
It specifically analyzes Section 483(2) BNSS, which mandates affording the informant/victim an opportunity of being heard in bail applications for sexual offenses involving minors. 
The case establishes that failure to provide such an opportunity renders the bail order unsustainable, directly aligning with the 'victim right bail BNSS' aspect of the query. 
While it doesn't mention BNSS Section 383, it discusses the overarching victim participation rights under the new code, which is a core aspect of the query.

7.  Gauhati High Court Itanagar Permanent Bench vs. Bulang Marik (19.05.2025 - GUHC)
Citation: MANU/GH/0307/2025
It involves a suo motu proceeding by the High Court to review and potentially cancel bail orders granted without hearing the victims, in contravention of mandatory High Court guidelines. 
The case, though not explicitly citing BNSS Section 383, directly addresses the procedural fairness and victim participation in bail proceedings, particularly in serious offenses like those under the POCSO Act and Section 376 IPC. 
It reinforces the mandatory nature of victim hearing, aligning with the 'victim right bail' aspect of the query under the new legal regime.

8. XXX vs. Konisa Abhishek and Ors. (06.05.2025 - APHC)
Citation: MANU/AP/0749/2025

It directly deals with the cancellation of a bail order due to the failure to provide the victim an opportunity to be heard, as mandated by Section 15A(3) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. 
While it predates BNSS and refers to the SC/ST Act, the core legal issue of a victim's mandatory right to be heard in bail proceedings is directly applicable and provides strong precedential value for the 'victim right bail' aspect of the query, especially concerning special statutes.

9. Mahesh Kumar Agrawal vs. State of Chhattisgarh (20.12.2021 - CGHC)
MANU/CG/0982/2021

It affirms the mandatory nature of Sections 15A(3) and 15A(5) of the SC/ST Act, 1989, which grant victims a statutory right to receive notice and be heard in bail proceedings, including appeals. 
Although it predates BNSS, its emphasis on the mandatory nature of victim participation in bail matters under a special statute provides a strong analogous precedent for interpreting victim rights under BNSS, particularly concerning the 'victim right bail' aspect of the query.

10. X vs. The State of West Bengal and Ors. (27.09.2024 - CALHC)
Citation: MANU/WB/2191/2024

It addresses the victim's right to be informed of bail/anticipatory bail proceedings, especially in sexual offense cases, under the new BNSS regime. 
It highlights the violation of BNSS Section 483(1A) (which is analogous to the query's implied BNSS victim rights) when victims are not notified. 
The case underscores police misconduct in diluting charges and procedural lapses in bail grants, directly linking to 'victim right bail BNSS' by discussing the new code's provisions for victim protection.

11. Arvind Madhukar Payaji vs. Suryakant Narse and Ors. (23.06.2021 - BOMHC)
Citation: MANU/MH/1556/2021

It clarifies the scope of a victim's right to participate in regular bail applications under the CrPC, specifically whether they can make direct oral submissions. 
While it predates BNSS, its detailed analysis of the Public Prosecutor's role and the victim's 'assistance' role under Section 301(2) CrPC provides foundational understanding of victim participation, which is crucial for interpreting similar provisions or the spirit of victim rights under BNSS. 
It directly addresses the 'victim right bail' aspect by defining the boundaries of victim intervention.

12. Ashok Govindram Hurra vs. State of Gujarat and Ors. (26.12.2011 - GUJHC)
Citation: MANU/GJ/1712/2011

It addresses the locus standi of a complainant to oppose an anticipatory bail application and make oral submissions to assist the Public Prosecutor. 
Although it refers to CrPC Section 24(8) and predates BNSS, the underlying principle of allowing victims/complainants to present factual aspects in bail hearings is directly applicable to the 'victim right bail' aspect of the query. It provides a historical context for the evolution of victim participation rights in bail matters.

13. Basheer vs. State of Kerala (18.03.2020 - KERHC)
Citation: MANU/KE/1481/2020

Victim's right to be heard under Section 15A(5) of the SC/ST Act in bail proceedings for bailable offenses. 
While it concludes that victim hearing is not mandatory for bailable offenses where the accused has an absolute right to bail, it directly engages with the 'victim right bail' issue. 
This case helps define the limits of victim participation, which is an important aspect of understanding the full scope of victim rights in bail under any procedural code, including BNSS.
